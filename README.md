# Project Journey Japan
Journey Japan is a web application catered to those who are thinking of traveling to Japan, been to Japan, or just genuinely interested about what Japan has to offer. Users will have the ability to create reviews on restaurants and attractions that they have been showcasing real experiences to give insight for other users about that restaurant or attraction. 

# User Story
- On the "Journey Japan" landing page users will be provided a short introduction of what the web application will provide.
- Users will be able to navigate the navbar to explore based on cities.
- After choosing the city they will be redirected to that city's show page which will be filled with userful information introducing them to the city. It will also include restaurants and attractions specific to that city.
- Users can pick from a list of restaurants or attractions that peak their interests which will take them to the show page for that restaurant/attraction. 
- Users can leave reviews for that restaurant/attraction.
- Users can login/signup for a account and upon doing so they will be able to create, edit, and delete their own reviews.
